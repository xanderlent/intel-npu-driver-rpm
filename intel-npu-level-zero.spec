%description
This is the user space driver for the Intel NPU device. It allows the use
of the Intel NPU via the Level Zero API.

The Intel NPU device is an AI inference accelerator integrated with Intel
client CPUs, starting from the Intel Core Ultra generation of CPUs (CPUs
formerly known as Meteor Lake). It enables energy-efficient execution of
artificial neural network tasks.

Note that while this device is officially called the Neural Processing Unit,
the Linux kernel driver uses the previous name of Versatile Processing Unit
(VPU).

%description validation
Validation programs & tests for the Intel NPU Driver for Linux.

These programs exercise the kernel-mode (kmd) and user-mode (umd) parts of
the driver.

Note that while this device is officially called the Neural Processing Unit,
the Linux kernel driver uses the previous name of Versatile Processing Unit
(VPU).
